# Rasa_chatbot
An Indian startup wants to build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities. The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience.

The customer can search using cuisine, place and average cost for 2 people and the chatbot will extract information as per the customer query and provide the results available in the cost range.

Also as an added functionality, the bot can send the searched restaurant list to their email id.

This chatbot is based on RASA open source solutioning. 

Privacy: No client data is used in this project. Zomato api is used to get the details of the restaurants as per customer's preference.
